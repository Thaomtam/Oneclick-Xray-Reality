# Xray-reality
This is a Bash script that installs Xray Beta and downloads the configuration for the repository created by [Teegrce](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk6D0n5Xy6EN16AE2g6q0uQ) for Vi·ªátNam inside this repository with your own key and places it only with one command üòè

## Installation Guide
just need you to run this command
```
 bash -c "$(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thaomtam/h2reality-install/main/install.sh)"
``` 
and it will do the rest for you.
## Note
1. I have only tested it on Ubuntu 22 and wrote it for that system. Although I have the time and willingness to write it for other systems, I don't think I will need to do so unless I am forced to.
2. I used ChatGPT to translate my words. Please pardon any mistakes in the translation.
